Building toward model cards and real-time event pattern detection.\n\n\nAI & Scholarship\nInvestigating hallucitated citations in academic work - when do they occur, who detects them, what contexts enable them? Pilot study in progress with GPTZero.\n\n\nEvaluation Methods\nComparing frameworks across educational and AI evaluation. Where do best practices converge? How do validity, replicability, and accessibility differ across domains?\n\n\nIntellectual Network Map\nInteractive visualization mapping personal reading collection across 8 core intellectual problem domains. Reveals conceptual connections, identifies knowledge gaps, and highlights bridge authors who span multiple fields. Built with Python/NetworkX and deployed as an interactive web application.\n\n\nResearch Tools\nDeveloping platforms for literature curation, citation management, knowledge synthesis, and conceptual mapping. Making research infrastructure accessible."
