    "text": "Research Philosophy\nIndependent research doesn’t require institutional affiliation to be rigorous. By combining: - Modern computational tools (LLMs, Python/R, Quarto) - Systematic evidence synthesis - Iterative tool development - Open science practices\n…we can tackle sophisticated questions about cognition, social behavior, and research practice itself."

Pilot study in progress with GPTZero.\n\n\nEvaluation Methods\nComparing frameworks across educational and AI evaluation. Where do best practices converge? How do validity, replicability, and accessibility differ across domains?\n\n\nResearch Tools\nDeveloping platforms for literature curation, citation management, knowledge synthesis, and conceptual mapping. Making research infrastructure accessible."

    "text": "Why “JAB Lab”?\nThe tongue-in-cheek name reflects the reality: this is self-funded, informal, and built on belief that creative research attracts the right opportunities - whether collaboration, employment, or eventually running a fully independent operation.\nThe informal style is a feature, not a bug. It enables rapid iteration, methodological flexibility, and focus on questions that matter rather than institutional politics."
