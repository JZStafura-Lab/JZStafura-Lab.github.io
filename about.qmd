## Mission

JAB Lab (Joe's Astoundingly Broke Lab) uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and execution of small-scale research. We embrace a learning-while-doing approach: systematic curation and synthesis paired with flexibility in execution.

## Research Philosophy

Independent research doesn't require institutional affiliation to be rigorous. By combining:
- Modern computational tools (LLMs, Python/R, Quarto)
- Systematic evidence synthesis
- Iterative tool development
- Open science practices

...we can tackle sophisticated questions about cognition, social behavior, and research practice itself.

## Current Focus Areas

### Violence Research
Multi-level evidence synthesis examining individual, relational, community, and societal factors. Building toward model cards and real-time event pattern detection.

### AI & Scholarship  
Investigating hallucitated citations in academic work - when do they occur, who detects them, what contexts enable them? Pilot study in progress with GPTZero.

### Evaluation Methods
Comparing frameworks across educational and AI evaluation. Where do best practices converge? How do validity, replicability, and accessibility differ across domains?

### Research Tools
Developing platforms for literature curation, citation management, knowledge synthesis, and conceptual mapping. Making research infrastructure accessible.

## Why "JAB Lab"?

The tongue-in-cheek name reflects the reality: this is self-funded, informal, and built on belief that creative research attracts the right opportunities - whether collaboration, employment, or eventually running a fully independent operation.

The informal style is a feature, not a bug. It enables rapid iteration, methodological flexibility, and focus on questions that matter rather than institutional politics.
