## Current Research

### [Violence Research Dashboard](/projects/violence/dashboard/)
Interactive evidence synthesis exploring ecological levels of violence across individual, relational, community, and societal factors. Building toward model cards and real-time event pattern detection.

**Methods:** Evidence synthesis, ecological systems modeling, interactive visualization

**Status:** Active - Dashboard deployed and expanding evidence base

### [Hallucitation Project](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/hallucitation-detection/)

Examining when and why AI-assisted writing produces fabricated citations in submitted and accepted academic papers. The study tests three pre-registered hypotheses: whether hallucination rates vary by (1) author expertise distance from the cited domain, (2) field publication velocity, and (3) paper section (e.g., Related Work vs. Methods).

**Methods:** Stratified sampling across venues, automated citation extraction, CrossRef verification, GPTZero scoring, systematic manual coding

**Status:** Pilot study — active pipeline development

### Evaluation Methods

Developing and validating assessment tools for individual and team performance. Emphasis on ecologically valid measurement in applied settings.

**Methods:** EMA, text-based data collection, psychometric validation, team network analysis

**Status:** Active - Tool development and field testing

### [Intellectual Network Map](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/intellectual-map/)

Interactive visualization of 450+ books organized by core intellectual problems rather than academic disciplines. Maps connections between 8 fundamental domains (Consciousness, Language, Violence, Social Structure, Aesthetic Experience, Self/Subject, Temporality, Place/Space), identifies knowledge gaps, and highlights bridge authors who span multiple fields.

**Methods:** Network analysis, Python/NetworkX, Plotly visualization, Wikipedia API integration, conceptual mapping

**Status:** Active - Live visualization deployed with interactive features
