## Welcome

JAB Lab uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and the execution of small-scale research. We take a learning-while-doing approach that ensures content knowledge development through systematic curation and synthesis, as well as flexibility in execution.

## Research Interests

Current work explores cognitive and social processes through evidence synthesis, computational methods, and tool development:

- **Violence research**: Multi-level evidence synthesis across individual, relational, community, and societal factors
- **AI evaluation**: Examining hallucinated citations in scholarly work; comparing evaluation frameworks in education vs. AI domains
- **Research tools**: Building platforms for literature curation, citation management, and knowledge synthesis
- **Intellectual mapping**: Systematizing conceptual relationships across domains
- **Ecological cognition**: Understanding socio-cognitive processes in naturalistic contexts

## About

I'm a cognitive psychologist with expertise in experimental design, statistical modeling, and data science. My research combines rigorous methodology with practical tool-building, using LLMs and modern data science to tackle questions about human cognition, social dynamics, and research practice itself.

**Background:**
- PhD in Cognitive Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience concentration)
- BA in Psychology and English Literature, Purchase College (Summa Cum Laude)
- EMA research experience (Saul Shiffman's lab, University of Pittsburgh)
- Founded digital platform company using SMS-based assessment for team performance and individual development

**Methods & Tools:**

*Statistical & Computational*
- GLM tradition, mixed models, psychometrics, SEM
- R, Python, SQL
- Quarto for reproducible research
- Git/GitHub for version control

*Research Infrastructure*
- LLM-assisted literature synthesis and curation
- Citation management and knowledge graphs
- Interactive dashboards and visualization
- Web-based research tools

*Data Collection*
- Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
- Experimental design
- Text-based and mobile platforms

## Current Work

**[Violence Research](/projects/violence/dashboard/)** - Interactive evidence synthesis dashboard exploring ecological levels of violence, with plans for model card development and real-time event tracking

**Hallucitation Study** - Pilot investigation of domain and expertise factors in AI-generated citation hallucinations (with GPTZero)

**Evaluation Methods** - Comparative analysis of frameworks and best practices across educational and AI evaluation domains

**[Intellectual Network Map](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/intellectual-map/)** - Interactive visualization mapping 450+ books across 8 intellectual problem domains, revealing connections and knowledge gaps
