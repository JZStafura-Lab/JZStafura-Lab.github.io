## Welcome

JAB Lab uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and the execution of small-scale research. We take a learning-while-doing approach that ensures content knowledge development through systematic curation and synthesis, as well as flexibility in execution.

## About

I'm a cognitive psychologist combining experimental rigor with modern computational tools. My work focuses on evidence synthesis, research infrastructure development, and AI-assisted scholarship analysis. [Learn more about my background and methods](/about.qmd)

## Current Projects

**[Violence Research Dashboard](/projects/violence/dashboard/)** - Multi-level evidence synthesis across individual, relational, community, and societal factors. Building toward model cards and real-time event pattern detection.

**[Hallucitation Study](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/hallucitation-detection/)** - Examining when and why AI-assisted writing produces fabricated citations. Tests three hypotheses: author expertise distance, field publication velocity, and section location.

**Evaluation Methods** - Comparative framework analysis across educational and AI evaluation domains. Where do best practices converge?

**[Intellectual Network Map](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/intellectual-map/)** - Interactive visualization mapping 450+ books across 8 intellectual problem domains, revealing conceptual connections and knowledge gaps

**Research Tools** - Developing platforms for literature curation, citation management, and knowledge synthesis
