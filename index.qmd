## Welcome

JAB Lab uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and the execution of small-scale research. We take a learning-while-doing approach that ensures content knowledge development through systematic curation and synthesis, as well as flexibility in execution.

## Research Interests

Current work explores cognitive and social processes through evidence synthesis, computational methods, and tool development:

- **Violence research**: Multi-level evidence synthesis across individual, relational, community, and societal factors
- **AI evaluation**: Examining hallucinated citations in scholarly work; comparing evaluation frameworks in education vs. AI domains
- **Research tools**: Building platforms for literature curation, citation management, and knowledge synthesis
- **Intellectual mapping**: Systematizing conceptual relationships across domains
- **Ecological cognition**: Understanding socio-cognitive processes in naturalistic contexts

## About

I'm a cognitive psychologist specializing in research synthesis, computational methods, and applied cognition. My work combines traditional experimental rigor with modern AI-assisted research tools to tackle questions in violence, scholarly integrity, and evaluation science.

**Background:**
- PhD in Cognitive Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience concentration), advised by Charles Perfetti
- Co-authored highly cited theoretical framework in reading comprehension (Perfetti & Stafura, 2014; 2046 citations, Google Scholar)
- First-author ERP study of word-to-text integration (Stafura & Perfetti, 2014, Neuropsychologia; 59 citations, Google Scholar)
- BA in Psychology & English Literature, Purchase College (Summa Cum Laude)
- EMA research experience, Saul Shiffman's lab (University of Pittsburgh)
- Founded SMS-based assessment platform for team performance and individual development

**Methods & Tools:**

*Statistical & Computational*
- Statistical modeling (GLM, mixed models, SEM, psychometrics)
- Programming and data science (R, Python, SQL, SAS, SPSS)
- Reproducible workflows (Quarto, Git, computational notebooks)
- Experimental design and ecological assessment methods

*Research Infrastructure & AI-Assisted Work*
- LLM-assisted research synthesis and evidence curation
- Interactive dashboard development (violence research, evaluation frameworks)
- Research administration tools (NOFO parsing, budget justification generation)
- Citation management and knowledge graphs
- Web-based research tools and visualization

## Current Work

**[Violence Research](/projects/violence/dashboard/)** - Interactive evidence synthesis dashboard exploring ecological levels of violence, with plans for model card development and real-time event tracking

**Hallucitation Study** - Pilot investigation of domain and expertise factors in AI-generated citation hallucinations (with GPTZero)

**Evaluation Methods** - Comparative analysis of frameworks and best practices across educational and AI evaluation domains

**[Intellectual Network Map](https://jzstafura-lab.github.io/intellectual-map/)** - Interactive visualization mapping 450+ books across 8 intellectual problem domains, revealing connections and knowledge gaps
