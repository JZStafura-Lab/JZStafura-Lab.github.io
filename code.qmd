## Research Infrastructure

### Evidence Synthesis Dashboards
Interactive web-based tools for systematic literature curation and knowledge synthesis.

**Featured:** [Violence Research Dashboard](/projects/violence/dashboard/) - Multi-level ecological evidence browser with citation management

**Technologies:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, JSON data structures, interactive filtering

**Status:** Active - Violence dashboard deployed

---

### LLM-Assisted Research Tools
Utilities for literature synthesis, citation extraction, and knowledge graph construction using large language models.

**Applications:** Automated citation parsing, theoretical framework extraction, model card generation

**Technologies:** Python, Claude API, prompt engineering, structured output parsing

**Status:** In development

---

### Citation & Reference Management
Tools for managing research literature, detecting hallucitated citations, and maintaining bibliographic databases.

**Technologies:** Python, BibTeX, JSON schemas, text analysis

**Status:** Active - Hallucitation detection pilot

---

## Analysis & Visualization

### Statistical Modeling
Reusable functions for mixed models, psychometric analysis, SEM, and longitudinal data.

**Technologies:** R (lme4, lavaan, psych), Python (statsmodels, scikit-learn)

**Status:** In development

---

### Interactive Dashboards
Custom visualization and reporting tools for research communication.

**Technologies:** R (ggplot2, plotly), Python (matplotlib, seaborn), Quarto, HTML/CSS

**Featured:** Ecological-level violence synthesis, citation browsers

**Status:** Active

---

### Reproducible Workflows
Quarto-based analysis pipelines for transparent, version-controlled research.

**Technologies:** Quarto, R Markdown, Jupyter, Git/GitHub

**Status:** Active - Lab website built with Quarto

---

## Data Collection (Legacy)

### Ecological Momentary Assessment
Tools for EMA and text-based data collection from previous work.

**Technologies:** Python, R, SMS APIs, mobile platforms

**Status:** Archived - Available for reference
