# JAB Lab

**Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience & Data Science**

This repository serves as both the source for the JAB Lab website and a hub for research code, tools, and documentation.

## About

JAB Lab uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and the execution of small scale research. We use a learning-while-doing approach that insures content knowledge development through systematic curation and synthesis, as well as flexibility in execution. Hopefully, we also help some people.

JAB Lab investigates human cognition through experimental methods, ecological assessment, and computational analytics. Research focuses on understanding socio- cognitive processes in naturalistic contexts, including with AI. 

**Principal Investigator:** Joseph Zach Staffura, PhD

## Current Projects

### Violence Research

Investigating cognitive and social factors underlying interpersonal violence, with focus on prediction, prevention, and intervention strategies.

### Hallucinations Study

Examining perceptual and cognitive mechanisms of hallucinations across clinical and non-clinical populations. Exploring phenomenology, neural correlates, and assessment methods.

### Evaluation Methods

Developing and validating assessment tools for individual and team performance. Emphasis on ecologically valid measurement in applied settings.
