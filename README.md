# JAB Lab

**Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience & Data Science**

This repository serves as both the source for the JAB Lab website and a hub for research code, tools, and documentation.

## About

JAB Lab uses modern technology to amplify the creation of research tools and the execution of small scale research. We use a learning-while-doing approach that ensures content knowledge development through systematic curation and synthesis, as well as flexibility in execution.

JAB Lab investigates human cognition through experimental methods, ecological assessment, and computational analytics. Research focuses on understanding socio-cognitive processes in naturalistic contexts.

**Principal Investigator:** Joseph Zachary (JZ) Stafura, PhD
